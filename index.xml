&lt;p>I’m Sam - a software engineer working and living in the San Francisco Bay Area, California 🌁. Born in Canton, China 🐉 and raised in Toronto, Canada 🍁, I’ve been shaped by a mix of cultures and experiences that fuel my curiosity and perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I’m not deep into code, I’m usually diving into the joys of family life with my two kids 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, hanging out with our cats 🐈‍⬛, or spending quality time with my spouse. Teaching my kids, exploring new hobbies, and just having fun with them is one of my greatest joys. I’m a huge fan of history, science, and engineering, and I love geeking out about soccer (or football, depending on where you’re reading this from). Oh, and speaking of soccer - GO &lt;a href="https://arsenal.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Arsenal F.C.&lt;/a>! ⚽️&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
