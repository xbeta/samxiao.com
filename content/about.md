Hey there! 👋

I’m Sam - a software engineer working and living in the San Francisco Bay Area, California 🌁. Born in Canton, China 🐉 and raised in Toronto, Canada 🍁, I’ve been shaped by a mix of cultures and experiences that fuel my curiosity and perspective.

When I’m not deep into code, I’m usually diving into the joys of family life with my two kids 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, hanging out with our cats 🐈‍⬛, or spending quality time with my spouse. Teaching my kids, exploring new hobbies, and just having fun with them is one of my greatest joys. I’m a huge fan of history, science, and engineering, and I love geeking out about soccer (or football, depending on where you’re reading this from). Oh, and speaking of soccer - GO [Arsenal F.C.](https://arsenal.com)! ⚽️

Curiosity drives me. Whether it’s learning something new about personal development, sports strategy, or how the world works, I’m always eager to grow. And if you know me, you’d probably agree I’m a bit of a workhorse—whether it’s in coding, tackling challenges, or cheering on the Gunners. 😉

My current timezone is [US - Pacific Time Zone (PT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone).

Thanks for stopping by. Cheers! 🎉
