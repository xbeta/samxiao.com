Welcome ðŸ‘‹,

Iâ€™m Sam Xiao â€” a software engineer, technical leader, and problem-solver with 15+ years of experience turning ideas into impactful technology. From starting as a founding engineer at a 7-person startup to working at hyper-growth companies, Iâ€™ve built and scaled systems for fintech, AI/ML, and data-driven products. Along the way, Iâ€™ve worn many hats â€” from backend, infosec, and DevOps to data engineering and MLOps â€” crafting solutions that handle scale and drive value.

Always love tackling tough problems with a pragmatic approach, combining first-principles thinking with practical execution. For me, leadership isnâ€™t about titlesâ€”itâ€™s about rolling up my sleeves, mentoring others, and fostering a culture where collaboration, accountability, and innovation thrive. Whether Iâ€™m building products from the ground up or aligning engineering with business priorities, my focus is always on keeping things simple, solving problems effectively, empowering teams and delivering results.

Thanks for visiting!
