Welcome ðŸ‘‹,

Iâ€™m Sam Xiao â€” a software engineer, technical leader, and problem-solver with 15+ years of experience turning ideas into impactful technology. From starting as a founding engineer at a 7-person startup to working at hyper-growth companies, Iâ€™ve built and scaled systems for fintech, AI/ML, and data-driven products. Along the way, Iâ€™ve worn many hats â€” from backend, infosec, and DevOps to data engineering and MLOps â€” crafting solutions that handle scale and drive value.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m endlessly curious about AI, machine learning, and how technology can improve lives.

Thanks for visiting!
