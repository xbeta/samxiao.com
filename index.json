Born in Canton, China 🐉 and raised in Toronto, Canada 🍁, I’ve been shaped by a mix of cultures and experiences that fuel my curiosity and perspective.\nWhen I’m not deep into code, I’m usually diving into the joys of family life with my two kids 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, hanging out with our cats 🐈‍⬛, or spending quality time with my spouse. Teaching my kids, exploring new hobbies, and just having fun with them is one of my greatest joys. I’m a huge fan of history, science, and engineering, and I love geeking out about soccer (or football, depending on where you’re reading this from). Oh, and speaking of soccer - GO Arsenal F.C.! ⚽️\nCuriosity drives me. Whether it’s learning something new about personal development, sports strategy, or how the world works, I’m always eager to grow. And if you know me, you’d probably agree I’m a bit of a workhorse—whether it’s in coding, tackling challenges, or cheering on the Gunners. 😉\nMy current timezone is US - Pacific Time Zone (PT).\nThanks for stopping by.

From starting as a founding engineer at a 7-person startup to working at hyper-growth companies, I’ve built and scaled systems for fintech, AI/ML, and data-driven products. Along the way, I’ve worn many hats — from backend, infosec, and DevOps to data engineering and MLOps — crafting solutions that handle scale and drive value.\nAlways love tackling tough problems with a pragmatic approach, combining first-principles thinking with practical execution. For me, leadership isn’t about titles—it’s about rolling up my sleeves, mentoring others, and fostering a culture where collaboration, accountability, and innovation thrive. Whether I’m building products from the ground up or aligning engineering with business priorities, my focus is always on keeping things simple, solving problems effectively, empowering teams and delivering results.\nThanks for visiting!\nLearn more ","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Sam Xiao","summary":"\u003c!--\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"flex rounded-md bg-primary-100 px-4 py-3 dark:bg-primary-900\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan class=\"pe-3 text-primary-400\"\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"icon relative inline-block px-1 align-text-bottom\"\u003e\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\"\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M256 0C114.6 0 0 114.6 0 256s114.6 256 256 256s256-114.6 256-256S397.4 0 256 0zM256 128c17.67 0 32 14.33 32 32c0 17.67-14.33 32-32 32S224 177.7 224 160C224 142.3 238.3 128 256 128zM296 384h-80C202.8 384 192 373.3 192 360s10.75-24 24-24h16v-64H224c-13.25 0-24-10.75-24-24S210.8 224 224 224h32c13.25 0 24 10.75 24 24v88h16c13.25 0 24 10.75 24 24S309.3 384 296 384z\"/\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan class=\"dark:text-neutral-300\"\u003eI am actively looking for a software engineer position, ideally (i) starting between October 2024 and January 2025, and (ii) in a field related to fintech, AI/ML or data.
